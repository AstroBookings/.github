Hi, my name is Rachel Ripley and I'm in charge of Astro Bookings' business operations.

As you know, we need your help with a software system to support our activities.

We work with several agencies that make **space trips on their passenger rockets**.

Travelers can book seats for passengers on these rockets for offered launches through our platform.

**Agencies** need a website to showcase their rockets and scheduled launches. Each **rocket** has a limited capacity of passengers and a destination range. It can be the Suborbital, Low Earth Orbit, or Interplanetary. Then, they can create **launch** offers with a price per seat, and the launch will take place from a well-known spaceport on a specific date and to a specific destination.

Launches may be delayed or aborted due to weather conditions, technical issues, or financial reasons on the agencies's side.

They want to be emailed about booking and cancellation statuses when they occur. They also want to see this information on the web, with the list of passengers and the amount of money collected for each launch.

We will issue them an invoice for using our platform after any successful or aborted launch.

**Travelers** can view available launches and reserve seats for passengers. They can also cancel their bookings and receive refunds, as our platform allows.

For each **booking**, they must fill in the contact information of the **passengers** who will be traveling. We only accept travelers who are between 18 and 70 years old. Reservation buyers must be informed of launch incidents.

Our financial **employees** must be able to see the status of bookings and launches to issue invoices to agencies.

They are also responsible for controlling the payment status of the invoices.

My colleagues from the marketing, financial, and technology departments will give you more requirements that your solution must fulfill.

Donâ€™t hesitate to ask anything you want. Best regards
