Hi there, this is Guy Godin the leader of Astro Bookings in the kingdom of digital marketing. But, you can call me CMO if you want.

We are thrilled to tell you about our marketing strategy. And the role we want your solution to play.

We need a **landing page** where we can showcase the next rocket launches with seats available so travelers can book reservations in a _first-come, first-served_ way.

Travelers can book up to four seats in any launch, but VIPs, who are travelers that have already booked two trips with us, can book two more.

When any supplier schedules a new launch, we want to **inform our VIP travelers by email**, giving them a link to the launch booking web page where they can reserve their trips. The link must be human-readable and SEO-friendly, including the rocket, spaceport, destination, and the date of the launch.

Travelers can **cancel** their bookings and will be refunded a portion of their money by the agency, if they do so well in advance.

Additionally, we are looking for a website that is not only SEO-friendly but also user-friendly and as fast as a rocket, to ensure a seamless customer experience.

Text me in the remote case if you have any doubts.
