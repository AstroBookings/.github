Good morning; my name is Warren, and I am the CFO of Astro Bookings Corporation.

I'm just writing to tell you how our company makes money.

We charge affiliated agencies a fee for using our platform for each launch operated, even if it is aborted.

Agencies must have a tax identification number and a legal address to comply with tax regulations.

We will invoice the agency for each successful launch operated on our platform. The fee will be 1% of the net revenue from the launch. After two releases, we will reduce the cost to 0.8%. Those are called reliable agencies.

If the launch is aborted, we will charge the agency a fee of 1000 USD for the operative costs.

If the customer cancels the booking, the agency will refund some of the money in certain situations. The amount will be 90% of the total cost if the cancellation is made one year before the launch and 70% if made three months before the launch. After that, the customer will not be refunded, and the seats will be considered sold due to the launch preparation time. Remember, we will charge the agency based on the their net benefit.

Every invoice must have a unique number, a legal date, and an amount. Invoices have a payment record with a status that our employees can update.

Of course, each invoice must be related to a launch for tracking purposes and can be sent to the agency by email.

I hope you and your family are safe and well.

> Warren R. Morris, Astro Bookings C.F.O.
