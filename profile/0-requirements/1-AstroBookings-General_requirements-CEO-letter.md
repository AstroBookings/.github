Hi, I'm Richard Mezzos; I am writing to ask you to develop a comprehensive software platform tailored to our operations.

AstroBookings' business model is to be an intermediary between large rocket launch agencies and space travelers.

Agencies must be able to schedule new rocket launches and manage customer bookings. We will charge them for the releases they make through our platform.

Travelers must have the ability to reserve seats on rockets to travel to space.

We hope that you will provide us with a solution that satisfies agencies, employees and travelers to easily offer, manage and reserve seats at rocket launches.

Of course, we also want to notify everyone of any reservations, cancellations, or issues at any release.

In the coming days, you will receive specific requirements from AstroBookings' operations, marketing, and technology departments.

Regards,
