## 👨‍🚀 About

I am Alberto Basalo, a seasoned (**LII** years old, almost from the Roman numerals era) advisor, consultor and instructor for programmers.

I am focused on coding best practices, testing, and software architecture, with a special bias for the JavaScript ecosystem.

I am glad to take you with me, hope I can help you to _develop your dream trip._
