### üí´ Learn to code by doing _a space travel booking_ project 

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è An open-source solution meant to teach you real coding skills.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è F**ull-stack development from requirements to deployment.**

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Modern technology and proven best practices.**

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Mission

- As a **programmers instructor**

- I want to **build in public a _real-world-full-stack-from-requirements-to-deployment_ solution**

- So I can **teach you the most.**


## üöÄ Astro Bookings

> A fictitious **space tourism** company that wants a platform to offer rocket tickets and reservation of rooms in space hotels.

Yeah, we will need to create an administrative application for employees, an API for providers, and a web portal for their clients. All backed with databases and real-time updates. **Tested and ready to use.**

## üõ∞Ô∏è The project

### üì°¬†**What about the technology and requirements?**

This will be something related to¬†**web technology and the JavaScript**¬†language ecosystem. So you need a basic understanding of web development. During the journey I will teach you:

- **TypeScript**
- **Node** with Express and NestJS
- **Git** and GitHub workflows
- **MongoDB** or a similar document database
- **PostgreSQL** or a similar relational database
- **RabbitMQ** or a similar message broker
- **Angular**, React, Svelte, or a similar front-end framework.
