# Astro Bookings

## Community Development

>Welcome to the home of this open learning project of building a **real-world-full-stack-from-requirements-to-deployment** solution.

## Who?

I am Alberto Basalo, a seasoned (L years old, almost from the roman numerals era) advisor and instructor for programmers.



## Mission

Build in public the biggest and best application that I can to teach you the most.



## Astro Bookings

A fictitious **space tourism** company that wants a platform to offer rocket tickets and reservation of rooms in space hotels.

Yeah, we will need to create an administrative application for employees and a web portal for their clients. All backed with databases and real-time updates. **A full-stack solution ready to use.**

Of course, *the truth is in the code*. And all the code, the project roadmap, supporting documentation, and deployment configuration will be at this organization.
