# Astro Bookings

## Community Development

> [_See project wiki for detailed info_](https://github.com/AstroBookings/.github/wiki)

### 💫 Learn to code by doing _a space travel booking_ project

#### ▶️ An open-source solution meant to teach you real coding skills.

#### ▶️ **Full-stack development from requirements to deployment.**

#### ▶️ **Modern technology and proven best practices.**

## 🧑‍🚀 Mission

- As a **programmers instructor**

- I want to **build in public a _real-world-full-stack-from-requirements-to-deployment_ solution**

- So I can **teach you the most.**

## 🚀 Astro Bookings

> A fictitious **space tourism** company that wants a platform for rocket suppliers to offer tickets for their launches to customers who want to fly into space.

### Suppliers

We work with agencies that offer seats at their rocket launches. They need a platform to manage their launches and sell tickets to customers.

They can create rockets, offer and cancel launches and check the status of their bookings.

### Customers

Customers can book seats for passengers of a launch, pay for it to us, and get a boarding pass. They can also check the status of their flight and get updates in real-time.

They are allowed to cancel their bookings and get a refund under certain conditions.

### Employees

Our employees can see the status of all launches, bookings, and customers.

They can also generate invoices for customers and send documents for suppliers with apropiate fee charges.

Yeah, we will need to create an administrative application for employees and suppliers, and a web portal for their customers. All backed with databases and real-time updates. **Tested and ready to use.**

## 🛰️ The project

### 📡 **What about the technology and requirements?**

This will be something related to **web technology and the JavaScript** language ecosystem. So you need a basic understanding of web development. During the journey I will teach you:

- **TypeScript**
- **Node** with Express and NestJS
- **Git** and GitHub workflows
- **MongoDB** or a similar document database
- **PostgreSQL** or a similar relational database
- **RabbitMQ** or a similar message broker
- **Angular**, React, Svelte, or a similar front-end framework.
