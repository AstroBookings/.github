```

This diagram illustrates the interfaces between the components involved in the Notification System domain:

1. SystemWeb interacts with NotifyAPI for notification management.
2. NotifyAPI interacts with OperationsDB for storing and retrieving notification data.
3. NotifyAPI connects to the external EmailSvc for sending email notifications.

## Related Entities

1. `Notification`:

   - Represents messages sent to system users about various events.
   - Contains fields such as id, recipient_email, subject, message, timestamp, status.

> Other related entities include `Agency` or `Traveler`, and `Launch` , `Booking` or `Invoice`, which are not directly involved in the notification system but are relevant for sending notifications to the respective users.

2. `User`:

   - Represents system users as a generalization for agencies or travelers
   - Contains fields such as id, email, name, role.

3. `Launch`, `Booking`, or `Invoice`:

   - Relevant entities related to the events for which notifications are sent.
   - Provide context for the notifications being sent.

4. `Template`:

   - Contains predefined message templates for notifications.
   - Includes fields such as id, name, subject, message.

    User {
        string id PK
        string email
        string name
        enum role
    }

    Notification {
        string id PK
        string template_id FK
        string agency_id FK
        string launch_id FK
        string traveler_id FK
        string booking_id FK
        string invoice_id FK
        string recipient_email
        string subject
        string message
        datetime timestamp
        enum status
    }

    Template {
        string id PK
        string name
        string subject
        string message
    }

   User ||--o{ Notification : "can receive"
   Booking o|--|{ Notification : "triggers"
   Invoice o|--|{ Notification : "triggers"
   Launch o|--|{ Notification : "triggers"
   Template ||--o{ Notification : "can be used in"
```

This ERD shows the following relationships:

- A `User` can have multiple `Notification` messages.
- A `Template` can be used in multiple `Notification` messages.
