Hi, my name is Rachel Ripley and I'm in charge of Astro Bookings' business operations.

As you know, we need your help to have a software system to support our activities.

We work with several companies that make **space trips on their passenger rockets**. We call them _suppliers_.

Travelers can book seats on these rockets for offered launches through our platform. We call them _customers_.

**Suppliers** needs a web site to showcase their rockets and scheduled launches. Each rocket has a limited capacity of passengers and destination range. It can be Low Earth Orbit, the ISS, Moon or even Mars. Then, they can create launch offers with a price per seat. The launch will take place from a spaceport in a specific date beyond one year.

Launches may be delayed or aborted due to weather conditions, technical issues, or other reasons. Launches can be aborted 3 months before if 80% of the seats are not filled.

They want to be informed by email of the status of bookings and cancellations when tey occurs. They also want to see this information on the web, with the list of passengers and the amount of money collected for each launch.

Our **employees** must be able to see the status of bookings and launches to issue invoices, pro-formas and refunds to customers and suppliers.

They are also responsible for controlling payments status of the invoices and refunds.

**Customers** can see the available launches and book seats. They can cancel their bookings and receive refunds according to the conditions of the launch offer.

For each booking they must fill the passenger contact information. We only accept bookings from customers who are at least 18 years old and younger than 70.They can book up to 4 seats in a launch. VIP customers can book up to 6 seats. VIPs are customers who have already booked 2 trips with us.

The also must be informed of the launch incidents and receive invoices and refunds according to the conditions of contracting services.

My colleagues from the marketing, financial and technology departments will give you more requirements to be fulfilled by your solution.

Donâ€™t hesitate to ask anything you want, best regards
