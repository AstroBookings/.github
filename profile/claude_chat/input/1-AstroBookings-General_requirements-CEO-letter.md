Hi, I’m Richard Mezzos, I’m writing to ask you to create the software platform to support our operations.

We need something reliable and future-proof that allows us to offer our customers trips _out-of-this-world_.

Our business is being an intermediary between _very very_ big affiliated suppliers and _very very_ rich travel customers.

We hope that you will provide us with an evolutionary solution that can be used by our suppliers, employees and customers to offer, manage and book rocket launches with ease.

Of course we also want to notify our client and providers of each reservation or cancellation on any launch.

We will charge customers for their bookings and pay suppliers for their services with a commission.

**Money is not a problem. Tech stack is up to you. But we want a full operating service by the end of 2024.**

In the the following days you will receive specific requirements from our operations, marketing and technology departments.

Regards,
