Hi there, this is Guy Godin the leader of Astro Bookings on the kingdom of digital marketing. But, you can call me CMO if you want.

We are thrilled to tell you about our marketing strategy. And the role we want your solution to play.

We need a **landing page** where we can showcase the next rocket launches with seats available so customers can book reservations in a _first-come, first-served_ way.

Any customer can book up to four seats in any launch, but VIPs can take two more. What is a VIP? Well, they are customers who have already booked two trips with us. We must identify them.

When any supplier scheduled a new launch, we want to **inform our VIP customers by email**, giving them a link to launch booking page where they could reserve their trips. The link must be human-readable and SEO-friendly, including the rocket, spaceport, destination and the date of the launch.

Customers can **cancel** their bookings and will be refunded a portion of their money if they do so well in advance.

One more thing, we want our site to be _SEO-friendly_, super easy to use, and fast as a rocket.

Text me in the remote case that you have any doubt.
