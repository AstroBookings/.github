Good morning, my name is Warren and I am the Chief Financial Officer of Astro Bookings Corporation.

I am only writing to tell you how our company makes money.

We are in charge of invoicing and collecting bookings from customers of any launch.

When the launch takes place, we send a document (a pro-forma invoice) to the supplier with the amount collected so that they can issue us the corresponding invoice.

In that pro-forma invoice, we will charge the supplier with a fee for using our platform. The fee will be 1% of the total cost of the launch. After 2 successful launches, we will reduce the fee to 0.8%.

If a customer cancels the booking, we will refund a portion of the money in certain situations. The amount will be 90% of the total cost if the cancellation is made 1 year before the launch, and 70% if it is made 3 months before. After that, the customer will not be refunded and seats will be considered sold due to the preparation time of the launch. To do so, we will generate and send a refund invoice for the affected booking.

A launch offer will be aborted if 20% of the seats are not filled 3 months before the launch date or for any other reason. In this case, we will refund the money to customers and charge the supplier with 1000USD for each booking sold for the operative costs. We need to issue an invoice to the supplier for the affected launch.

Every invoice, refund invoice, and pro-forma invoice must have a number, a legal date and an amount. Invoices has a payment record with a status that can be updated by our employees. Of course each invoice must be related with a booking (when issued to a customer) or a launch (when is a pro-forma issued to a supplier) and must have a recipient (customer or supplier).

Invoices need to be sent as notifications by email to the recipient.

Hope you and your family are safe and well.
