2. Domain model:
   1. Entities and their relationships
   2. Attributes with their types, restrictions, and relationships
   3. Mermaid diagram code
3. System architecture:

   2. Interfaces and their relationships

Write the documents in Markdown format.
Write the documents in a clear and concise way.
Write the documents in English, even if conversing in another language.

Read the following instructions to generate the documents.

## 1. Use cases and user stories

1. Identify the actors and their roles.
2. Identify the use cases.
3. Write the use cases in the following format:

```markdown
### Use case name

**Actors**: `Actor 1`, `Actor 2`, ...
**Description**: Description
**Preconditions**: Preconditions
**Normal flow**:

1. Step 1
2. Step 2

**Postconditions**: Postconditions
```

1. Write the user stories in the following format:

```markdown
### User story name

As a `role`, I want to `goal`, so that `reason`.

**Acceptance criteria**:

1. Criterion 1
2. Criterion 2
```

## 2. Domain model

### 1. Entities and their relationships

1. Identify the entities
2. Name the entities following the PascalCase convention in singular form
3. Identify the relationships between the entities
4. Specify the kind and cardinality of the relationships

```markdown
# Entities

- `Entity_1`: Description
- `Entity_2`: Description

# Relationships

- `Entity 1` _kind_ `Entity 2`: (Cardinality)
```

### 2. Attributes with their types, restrictions, and relationships

1. Identify only the natural attributes of the entities
2. Name the attributes following the camelCase convention

Convention:

- `*` for mandatory attributes
- `[]` for valid values
- `()` for valid ranges

```markdown
# Attributes

- `Entity 1`:
  - `*attribute_1`: Type
  - `*attribute_2`: Type [Valid values]
  - `attribute_3`: Type (valid ranges)
```

### 3. Mermaid diagram code

1. Draw the diagram using the `Mermaid` syntax

```mermaid
erDiagram
  CUSTOMER {
    string id
    string name
  }
  ORDER {
    string id
    string date
  }
  CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : "places"
  COURSE {
    string id
    string name
  }
  STUDENT {
    string id
    string name
  }
  STUDENT }o--o{ COURSE : "enrolls"
  USER {
    string id
    string email
    string password
  }
  EMPLOYEE {
    string id
    string name
  }
  EMPLOYEE o|--|| USER : "is a"
```

## 3. System architecture

### 1. Components (applications, and services) and their relationships

1. Identify the components
2. Identify the relationships between the components

```markdown
# Components

- `Web application`: Description
- `API service`: Description
- `Relational Database`: Description
- `NoSQL Database`: Description
- `Message Broker`: Description
- `External Service`: Description
```

### 2. Interfaces and their relationships

1. Identify the interfaces
2. Identify the relationships between the interfaces

```mermaid
graph TD
  Web_Application -->|HTTP| API_Service
  API_Service -->|JDBC| Relational_Database
  API_Service -->|HTTP| External_Service
  API_Service -->|AMQP| Message_Broker
  API_Service -->|JDBC| NoSQL_Database
```
