This diagram illustrates the interfaces between the components involved in the Notification System domain:

1. SystemWeb interacts with NotifyAPI for notification management.
2. NotifyAPI interacts with SystemDB for storing and retrieving notification data.
3. NotifyAPI connects to the external EmailSvc for sending email notifications.

    User {
        int id PK
        string email
        string password_hash
        string name
        enum role
    }

    Notification {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        string message
        datetime timestamp
        enum status
    }
```

This ERD shows the following relationships:

- A `User` can have multiple `Notification` messages.
