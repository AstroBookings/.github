- Implement an invoice generation system for successful launches.
- Apply fee rates based on agency reliability (1% for new agencies, 0.8% for reliable agencies).
- Include all necessary information on the invoice (launch details, number of passengers, total revenue, fee amount).

### 3.2 As an employee, I want to generate invoices for agencies for aborted launches to cover platform usage costs.

- Create a system to generate fixed-fee invoices (1000 USD) for aborted launches.

- Implement a system to record and update payment status of invoices.
- Provide options to mark invoices as paid, partially paid, or overdue.
- Set up automated reminders for overdue invoices.

### 3.4 As an employee, I want to view a revenue report for each agency to analyze their financial performance.

- Generate detailed revenue reports for each agency.
- Include information such as number of launches, total revenue, fees paid, and reliability status.
- Provide options to view reports for different time periods (monthly, quarterly, annually).

### 3.5 As an employee, I want to generate an annual report of actual and pending revenues to assess the overall financial health of the platform.

- Create a comprehensive annual financial report.

This diagram illustrates the interfaces between the components involved in the Financial Operations domain:

1. SystemWeb interacts with FinanceAPI for all financial management operations.
2. FinanceAPI interacts with OperationsDB for storing and retrieving financial data.
3. FinanceAPI connects to the external PaymentGW for processing payments.

    Agency {
        int user_id PK,FK
        string description
        string contact_info
        string legal_name
        string tax_id
        string legal_address
    }

    Launch {
        int id PK
        int agency_id FK
        int rocket_id FK
        datetime date
        string destination
        decimal price_per_seat
        enum status
    }

    Invoice {
        int id PK
        string number
        int agency_id FK
        int launch_id FK
        decimal amount
        enum status
        datetime date
    }

    Payment {
        int id PK
        int invoice_id FK
        decimal amount
        datetime date
        enum status
    }

    Agency ||--o{ Invoice : "is billed by"
    Launch ||--o| Invoice : "generates"
    Invoice ||--o{ Payment : "is paid by"
```

This ERD shows the following relationships:

- An `Agency` can be billed by multiple `Invoice` records.
- A `Launch` can one `Invoice` record.
- An `Invoice` can be paid by multiple `Payment` records.
