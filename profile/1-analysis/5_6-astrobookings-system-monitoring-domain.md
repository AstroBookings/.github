# AstroBookings: System Monitoring Domain

> Timestamp: 2024-08-21 17:00:00 UTC

The System Monitoring domain in AstroBookings provides logging and system status monitoring for IT operations. It ensures that the platform's activities are tracked and that the system's health can be monitored effectively.

## User Stories

### 6.1 As a system, I want to save logs of all activities to maintain a record of what has happened.

- Implement a robust logging system that captures all significant system events.
- Include relevant details such as timestamp, event type, and associated user/process.
- Ensure logs are stored securely and are easily searchable.

### 6.2 As an IT employee, I want to view system logs to monitor system behavior.

- Create a user interface for IT employees to view and analyze system logs.
- Implement filtering and search functionality to easily find relevant log entries.
- Provide options to export logs for further analysis.

### 6.3 As an IT employee, I want to check the status of the notification service.

- Develop a dashboard specifically for monitoring the notification service.
- Display metrics such as service uptime, number of notifications sent/failed, and current queue size.
- Implement real-time updates for the dashboard.

## Affected Components

### üåê Web Applications

- `üåê SystemWeb`: Administrative interface for AstroBookings employees.

### üßë‚Äçüíº API Services

- `üßë‚Äçüíº SystemAPI`: Handles authentication, authorization, and system-wide operations.

### üìá Databases

- `üìá SystemDB`: Stores user profiles, authentication data, system logs, notification queue, and sync operations queue.

## Component Interfaces

```mermaid

    subgraph WebApplications[ ]
        AuthWeb(0 - AuthWeb)
        SystemWeb(4 - SystemWeb)
    end

    subgraph APIServices[ ]
        SystemAPI[0 - SystemAPI]
    end

    subgraph Databases[ ]
        SystemDB[(0 - SystemDB)]
    end

     %% Web to Web connections
    SystemWeb <-.-> AuthWeb

    %% Web to API connections
    SystemWeb --> SystemAPI

    %% API to Database connections
    SystemAPI --> SystemDB

    %% Style

    classDef api fill:#C1E1C1,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef db fill:#FFFFE0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class SystemWeb web;
    class SystemAPI api;
    class SystemDB db;
```

This diagram illustrates the interfaces between the components involved in the System Monitoring domain:

1. SystemWeb interacts with SystemAPI for accessing monitoring functionalities.
2. SystemAPI interacts with SystemDB for storing and retrieving system logs and monitoring data.

## Related Entities

1. `EntryLog`:
   - Represents system activity logs, used for monitoring and auditing.
   - Contains fields such as id, entity_type, entity_id, action, timestamp, details.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
    EntryLog {
        int id PK
        string entity_type
        int entity_id
        string action
        datetime timestamp
        string details
    }
```

This entity is not directly related to the existing entities.
Indirectly reference other entities in the system by:

- `entity_type`: The type of entity being synchronized.
- `entity_id`: The ID of the entity being synchronized.
