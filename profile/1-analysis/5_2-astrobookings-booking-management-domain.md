This diagram illustrates the interfaces between the components involved in the Booking Management domain:

1. PublicWeb and TravelerWeb interact with BookingAPI for all booking-related operations.
2. BookingAPI interacts with OperationsDB for persistent storage of booking data.
3. BookingAPI also uses CacheDB for quick access to frequently requested information.

## Related Entities

   - Contains fields such as id, traveler_id, launch_id, number_of_seats, total_price, status.

2. `Launch`:

   - Represents a scheduled space trip.
   - Contains fields such as id, agency_id, rocket_id, date, destination, price_per_seat, available_seats, status.

3. `Traveler`:
   - Represents a registered user who can make bookings.
   - Contains fields such as user_id, contact_phone, emergency_contact, travel_preferences.

    Traveler {
        int user_id PK,FK
        string contact_phone
        string emergency_contact
        json travel_preferences
    }

    Launch {
        int id PK
        int agency_id FK
        int rocket_id FK
        datetime date
        string destination
        decimal price_per_seat
        enum status
    }

    Booking {
        int id PK
        int traveler_id FK
        int launch_id FK
        int number_of_seats
        decimal total_price
        enum status
    }

    Traveler ||--o{ Booking : makes
    Launch ||--o{ Booking : has
```

This ERD shows the following relationships:

- A `Traveler` can make multiple `Booking` records.
- A `Launch` can have multiple `Booking` records.
